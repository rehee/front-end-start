this project is all in one front end developer package

can use angular1/2 vue2 react.

1. npm install
2. npm install -g http-server
3. webpack -w
4. http-server


notice
1. if use react, need import react.js as dependence

```html
<script src="/node_modules/react/dist/react.js"></script>
<script src="/node_modules/react-dom/dist/react-dom.js"></script>
```

2 angular 2 cannot package in the project. the easist way is create an blank angular2 cli project. and copy all angular2 file to the blank project then build by angular2 cli. [link](https://cli.angular.io/)
